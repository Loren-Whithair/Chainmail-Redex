# Chainmail-Redex

A repo to store our work with the Chainmail language, along with exercises and other work we've done in Redex.

Our focus is modelling the Chainmail language in Redex, which is written about in this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08334


A good reference for our project has been Javalite (similar to Featherweight Java, with more features) modelled in PLT Redex: https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4375&context=etd&httpsredir=1&referer=

We also use the above to help model Featherweight Java which can be read about here: https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/fj-toplas.pdf
