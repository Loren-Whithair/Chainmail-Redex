; This is a Loo program example that uses all six reduction rules.
;
; The program starts with a call to create a new myClass object, passing in p1 (which has the value of 1) as a parameter, this is then assigned tio the field f1.
; We then do a method call to the internal method m_0 and assign the result to local variable (x_0). This method returns the value assigned to the field f1.
; We then return 'this' from the constructor which returns a new reference to the location in the heap of our object.
; Since it is a new object, a new pointer in the heap will be assigned which points to our object (value of 4 in this case).
; After evaluation, we expect p1, f1 and x_0 to all point to the same value of 1. Running the program shows that this is in fact what happens.
