; Problems to solve:
; - how to restrict the NAME of the constructor (i.e. we want the C in K to be the same as the class we are defining
; - - judgment declaration, or reduction?
; - how to get the information of the class defns and use it to reduce E 
; - restrict the number of constructor params to the number of fields in the class (this requires subbing K for it's decl in the decl of L)


; TODO
; define a program execution (define-extended-language prog FJ)
; give a judgment-form for subtypes
